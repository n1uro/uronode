Incase you're wondering about the method behind the madness in my color
schema it's very simple. Picture yourself with 3 vehicles to drive on
different roads with; a scooter, a compact car, and an SUV. Each vehicle
(or protocol) has it's own color. Each vehicle follows the same rules
of the road (green for go, red for stop, blinking red for alarms). When
you command URONode to go somewhere, you get green. When you return and
the process has completed it's red. Ax25/Flex is Yellow, NetRom is Cyan,
and IP/System messages are Magenta.

It's VERY IMPORTANT that you program any automated scripts that connect
to URONode that they do NOT use colors! Simply remove 512 from their
permissions. If you do NOT do this, the robot script may attempt to 
decipher ANSI code and it may cause it to hang. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!


Here's the schema:
Connects display in green as in "gateway go"
Reconnects display in red as in "gateway stop"
IP based information is in magenta
Netrom Nodes (full list) in bold cyan
FlexNet destis (full list) in yellow
System info in bright white
Aborts and timeouts blink bright red
Logouts in low cyan
